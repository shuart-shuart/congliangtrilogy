			Sheng Lan 胜兰was the daughter of Ya Lan, born in 1924, her name reflected her 
			mother's wish that Sheng Lan would surpass her mother. She was sent to a 
			<a href=”https://mothership.sg/2018/12/cabaret-girls-prostitution-gangs-lancing/” target="_blank">gewutuan</a> 
			(dance troupe) in 
			<a href=“https://roots.sg/learn/stories/themeparks-in-singapore/story” target="_blank">Great World</a> 
			at the age of four, where she did extremely well, scoring solo acts and yielding a high income. Her 
			ability to earn money greatly supplemented the club's many war and educational efforts. She later went to 
			<a href=“https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1044_2006-06-01.html” target="_blank">Happy World</a> 
			when it opened, and switched towards investments when business started to dwindle.

			Sheng Lan was the gem of her mother and her two friends, the trio made sure Sheng Lan 
			was educated both formally and informally. She was devasted when she lost them during 
			the Japanese Occupation but made it her mission to continue their legacy, helping women 
			to earn a fair living and to be free. Sheng Lan joined the club at the same time as 
			<a href=“https://www.swhf.sg/profiles/may-wong/” target="_blank">May Wong</a>, 
			one of the important figures in Singapore’s feminist scene. Sheng Lan was always 
			thinking ahead and made many timely investments, her

			allowed the club to pursue many activities. This includes the vocational school she 
			set up from 1972-83 and the various student activism events her daughter and younger 
			members of the club were part of. Sheng Lan's support for training and educational 
			platforms helped women transit from the night entertainment industry to the hospitality 
			industry as Singapore developed her tourism sector. She led the other members to save and 
			invest, even providing for childless members in their old age.
