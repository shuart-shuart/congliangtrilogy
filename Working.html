	<h1>仨兰</h1>

    <p id="Para01">
        Rumoured to be sold into the trade by <a href=”url” id="link1">pirate ships</a>, 
        Ya Lan 雅兰 was one of the most popular prostitutes in the 1910s-30s. 
        Unlike most <a href=”url” id="link2">prostitutes</a>, 
        Ya Lan was beautiful and carried an air of poise bordering on haughtiness. 
        She was skilled in the four classical skills expected of daughters from respectable 
        families- music, chess, literature, and painting. 
        Her skills and smarts an ensuing legacy of eight famous 
        <a href=”url” id="link3">the Late Ming courtesans</a>.
    </p> <br>
    
    <p id="Para02">
        The talented and read lady was plagued  by the worst vice-
        <a href=”url” id="link4">opium addiction</a>. 
        Like many other intelligent girls, the pimps kept them trapped in the brothels 
        through forced opium intake and then addiction. 
        She hated how her life was controlled and ruined by men, 
        despite earning quite well, she struggled to save up to 
        <a href=”url” id="link5">bail herself</a> as her salary went to her drugs. 
        Ya Lan barely trusted anyone, especially not since most of her sisters were always 
        leaving, either due to death, getting bought, suicide or escape. 
        Why did someone like Ya Lan choose not to escape? She was too famous, 
        if she left without buying herself out, she would never find a place to live or 
        work without being ousted. She would rather be in the whorehouse than work for 
        any of the Europeans who enabled all these vices to exist. Ya Lan’s greatest 
        aspiration and sole goal was to earn money so she could be free and independent, 
        despite the undignified and rough work.
    </p> <br>
    
    <p id="Para03"> 
        In 1924, when the KK Hospital became a 
        <a href=”url” id="link6">free maternity hospital</a>, 
        Ya Lan, who was impregnated by a client, admitted herself.  
        As a prostitute, her children were seen as commodities 
        and were sold the moment they weened. Having seen her sisters go 
        through that pain, Ya Lan did not want her baby to be taken away. 
        Desperate to break out of the cycle, Ya Lan befriended the head nurse, Miao Chun 妙春. 
        Ya Lan gifted  her beautiful jewelry to the lady, everything that was elegant but discreet. 
        She charmed the lady with her songs and poured her heart out. When she delivered, 
        Miao Chun was offered Ya Lan’s most valuable possession, her Daughter. 
        The head nurse could not help her new friend, women simply did not possess 
        the space nor capacity to take in a new girl. Ya Lan was desperate, 
        she begged and cried, even going on a hunger strike despite the heavy blood loss 
        she suffered from the delivery. In the end, Miao Chun relented and the two found 
        themselves in a dusty storeroom.
    </p> <br>
    
    <p id="Para04"> 
        This room was the beginning of a seven decades legacy. Allegedly haunted, 
        none of the hospital staff dared to go near to this room. It was dark and dingy, 
        with no windows. Fortunately, it was obscured and had thicker walls than the wards. 
        This room that was more like a cell was to be the baby’s home. Touched by the generosity 
        of Miao Chun, Ya Lan felt that she had found a true friend after all these years. 
        She named her daughter Sheng Lan 胜兰, alluding to the Chinese proverb 
        <a href=”url” id="link7">青出于蓝，而胜于蓝</a> 
        and her name- she wanted her daughter to be better than the old generation and better 
        than herself. She vowed to help all other women she saw in the same plight, 
        so that her daughter had a better world to live in.
    </p> <br>
    
    <p id="Para05"> 
        The two women took turns to tend to the baby , trying to see her every 4 hours. 
        But it was tough for Miao Chun to find time amongst her duties and even harder 
        for Ya Lan to travel out after the sunset. Ya Lan painted a diptych of Orchids, 
        for her and her daughter, this painting was the closest semblance to a window for 
        the four walls. Miraculously, the arrangement between the two women saw 
        Sheng Lan grow to the age of two healthily.
    </p> <br>
    
    <p id="Para06"> 
        During the wee hours of the <a href=”url” id="link8">Lunar New Year’s Eve</a> 
        in 1926, Miao Chun suddenly brought a pair of 
        <a href=”url” id="link9" >Ma Jie</a>’s into the same room. 
        One of them, Ah Jiao阿娇 had in her hands a girl slightly younger than her, 
        both of them had a <a href=”url” id="link10">matching bracelet</a> of Chinese knots. 
        Shuang Shuang 双双 and Ah Jiao came from the same village in Shunde . 
        When Shuang Shuang’s relative suspected her of having a lover, the woman who 
        had sworn herself to 
        <span onclick="showMedia17()" id="Span17" class="openMedia">celibacy</span>

	function showMedia17() {

	</span>
         was thrown into the river. This was a punishment 
        many women endured, usually costing their lives. Women were forced into a 
        <a href=”url” id="link11">bamboo cage</a> and left submerged in water for the 
        duration of one to two hours before they were released. Shuang Shuang was saved 
        by Ah Jiao with the help of the other Ma Jie’s but since news had gotten out, 
        the girl was not to be seen in the public again for a while. This accident 
        <a href=”url” id="link12">scarred her deeply</a>, she was easily started and 
        had an adverse reaction to any form of touch, other than when petting baby Sheng Lan. 
    </p> <br>
    
    <p id="Para07"> 
        Ya Lan welcomed the idea of the two Ma Jie’s in the room but remained apprehensive 
        of allowing the unstable Shuang Shuang to interact with her daughter. The two 
        Ma Jie’s became Sheng Lan’s nannies. Other than working, Ah Jiao also worked 
        very hard to help Shuang Shuang with her trauma. The four women began 
        to spend time together in the room, 
        <a href=”url” id="link13">a room of their own</a>. 
        Two years later, Ya Lan decided to leave her girl with the 
        <a href=”url” id="link14">gewutuan</a> (dance troupe ) of 
        <a href=”url” id="link15">New World </a>. 
        This was despite the others’ protest, but it was the best and most comfortable way 
        out for her daughter in her eyes. To commemorate that event, Ya Lan named the room 
        <a href=”url” id="link16">从良</a>室 
        hoping that all of the women can be free and have a fair livelihood. 
        By then, Shuang Shuang was in a better state, Miao Chun managed to arrange for a 
        new European family to hire her . She went on to serve on that estate and 
        lived on-site for the next seven years.
    </p> <br>
    
    <p id="Para08"> 
        Ya Lan continued to meet with Sheng Lan every Sunday in the room. The three women 
        also met up weekly and have all gone through the pains of being women, 
        decided to try to change the state of things. The young Sheng Lan was their beacon of hope, 
        they all tried to impart their skills and knowledge to her. Even though 
        barely older than a toddler and perhaps trained by the dancers, Sheng Lan was 
        very perceptive and learnt fast. Seeing the girl’s progress gave the three women 
        hope, they wanted to help more than just one girl and wanted to share 
        their knowledge with other women. Miao Chun began to bring Ya Lan and Ah Jiao to 
        disadvantaged Chinese women she met through the hospital when all of them were free. 
        Ya Lan taught the women how to read important characters  to prevent being duped and 
        also shared about things she learnt from speaking with her clients. Ah Jiao imparted 
        her wisdom on housekeeping matters while Miao Chun advised on health matters 
        and sexual education . Their well-intentions received a mixed reception, 
        but the power of three women was limited. They agreed that personally teaching 
        each woman they met was not practical and was too tiring. Most of the women 
        they reached out to were from the 
        <a href=”url” id="link17">Caton</a> or 
        <a href=”url” id="link18">Hokkien</a> region like themselves.
    </p> <br>
    
    <p id="Para09"> 
        Ya Lan proposed that the three women came up with a version of the 
        <a href=”url” id="link19">Four Books and Five Classics 四书五经</a> 
        for the contemporary <a href=”url” id="link20">Chinese Straits Women</a>. 
        For the next year, Ya Lan worked tirelessly to illustrate with as little words, 
        if not none at all, the knowledge the three of them shared. Miao Chun’s knowledge 
        resulted in a booklet on child-rearing and infant care. Together with Ya Lan, 
        they came up with a simple booklet on sexual health and education, showing symptoms 
        of sexually transmitted diseases  and care for the female body. Miao Chun and 
        Ah Jiao came up with the third book, a picture book on common remedies and 
        treatment for infections, wounds and tropical diseases. The last book was 
        Ya Lan’s favourite, concentrating on 
        women’s crafts, paintings, and classical songs and poetry.
    </p> <br>
    
    <p id="Para10"> 
        Judged on today’s standards, the four booklets were scarce and also contained 
        some factual errors. Nevertheless, such an effort to collate and proliferate 
        collective wisdom amongst women was pioneering. This tomb equipped the ladies with 
        materials that they can use and share with others. Due to cost concerns, they used 
        the paper and ink bought to duplicate the first three books. The original copy was 
        always kept in the room and with three more meant to be loaned out. By the end of 1930, 
        the ladies had refined their booklets and seen enough success with it. The challenge
        was now to make the booklets even more conspicuous and easily distributed.
    </p> <br>
    
    <p id="Para11"> 
        In 1931, Ya Lan managed to get in touch with a Malay printer in the 
        <a href=”url”  id="link21">Malaya Publishing House</a>. With their combined savings, 
        the women printed fifteen copies of the four booklets. Working in secrecy, 
        they managed to get the books to many households in Chinatown. 
    </p> <br>
    
    <p id="Para12"> 
        In 1932, Ah Jiao received a letter from a fellow Ma Jie, in it a letter addressed t
        o “sisters” and with some cash. The ladies came together, with Ya Lan reading the letter, 
        “Dear sisters, I do not know who you are, and I cannot leave the house to search for you. 
        But one day, I found these wonderful and beautiful books in my ma jie’s room. 
        You are doing work that will benefit the future generations, let me help you in the ways I can. 
        Enclosed is some money, please use it to print more of these books, but do so safely. 
        If you are found out, the things you are sharing might be misunderstood by the men and British bastards. 
        Keep yourselves unseen, but your knowledge omnipresent.”
    </p> <br>
    
    <p id="Para13">
    	The donation was enough for the ladies to increase the spread of their operations. 
    	Discussing a way forward, they also brought up the issue of recruiting more members. 
    	The trio decided to come up with a nomination list of twenty names, 
    	Ya Lan would then test their intelligence and Ah Jiao their tenacity and 
    	physical health. This led them to recruit five more members, including 
    	<a href=”url”  id="link22">May Wong</a>, Sheng Lan, and Shuang Shuang. 
    	The three pioneers also came up with a new character for their secret society- 彳良. 
    	The day after 1933’s <a href=”url”  id="link23">Spring Lantern festival 元宵</a>, 
    	the eight women gathered in the room. Ah Jiao led the 
    	<a href=”url”  id="link24">swearing-in</a>, 
    	where they swore to secrecy and the service of other sisters. 
    	They each received a pair of earrings  with a special stamp engraved, 
    	each sister signed beside their personalized stamp.  
    </p> <br>
    
    <p id="Para14">
        With the addition of new members, the spreading of knowledge went faster and more 
        efficiently. Ya Lan and May Wong also held reading and writing lessons  for all 
        the members, progress was slow as they barely had time to meet and run their programs. 
        To save costs and stay discreet, the women only received a brush, they wrote and 
        <a href=”url”  id="link25">practiced with water</a> for the first year. By 1934, 
        they were all equipped with basic writing skills. May Wong was also an important 
        link between the secret society’s effort and the more official 
        <a href=”url”  id="link26">Chinese Women Association</a>. 
        She eventually left the club after the war as she took up the presidency in the 
        association. However, the knowledge and sisterhood she gained from her membership 
        informed her service in the association greatly. 
    </p> <br>
    
    <p id="Para15">
       Over the past decade, Ya Lan worked hard to teach Sheng Lan all the knowledge and 
       life experiences she had, she knew her daughter was only ten, but it never hurt 
       to know more. She also worked extremely hard to curb her opium addiction, 
       surrendering her earnings to her two sisters or pouring it into their operations. 
       This left her in great pain, but it did aid her road to being clean. The tough 
       journey added to her long hatred of the Europeans, the 
       <a href=”url”  id="link27">Opium War</a> 
       of the previous generation still etched in the hearts of the Chinese. 
       Ya Lan proposed that they should try to open a joint bank account. 
       This idea was not well-received, many preferred to keep mum about their 
       financial situation and did not want to risk exposing their private stash by bringing it to the 
       <a href=”url”  id="link28">bank</a>. 
       Some of them were also skeptical of whether the banks will take their money away.
    </p> <br>
    
    <p id="Para16"> 
        As <a href=”url”  id="link29">World War Two</a> broke out in 1937, Ah Jiao 
        proposed to start a fund-raising events to contribute to the 
        <a href=”url” id="link30">war relief fund for China</a>. 
        This idea was well supported, but they were stuck with what could be done to raise funds. 
        By now, Ya Lan was a senior in her brothel and had access to many rich and prolific clients. 
        With Ah Jiao and Miao Chun’s expertise in medicine, they made a powder 
        that could make a man impotent for a few days . Ya Lan and other sisters 
        who worked in brothels would <a href=”url” id="link31">spike the alcohol</a> 
        with this powder and some of the sisters will then catch the embarrassed 
        and worried men right outside. They would then peddle a special 
        <a href=”url” id="link32">Tongkat Ali pills</a>, 
        which were just cheap tea leaves grounded up and rolled with some hay and bean paste. 
        The women did this twice a week to avoid blowing their cover. The women also 
        volunteered letter writing services for free, contributing to the ease of 
        communication between those in Singapore and China. 
        These efforts continued and the women also started to grow 
        <a href=”url” id="link33">tapioca</a> and made snacks from them to sell. 
        Based on records, they managed to raise an amount worth $2000 today over the three years. 
        In 1939, Sheng Lan was also scouted to join the gewutuan in 
        <a href=”url” id="link34">Gay World</a>, 
        she opened a solo act and donated all her tips to the cause. 
    </p> <br>
    
    <p id="Para17"> 
        In 1941, the <a href=”url” id="link35">Japanese attacked Singapore</a> 
        and the women were stranded in their efforts to meet. Meetings became as infrequent as once a month, 
        during which they worked out a method to correspond and keep tabs on each other’s safety. 
        The women made a pact to care for each other’s offspring should anything happen to them. 
        The stamps and correspondence system  proved to be helpful when 
        the hospital fell into the hands of the Japanese when Singapore fell in 1942. 
        Converted into a <a href=”url” id="link36">“general hospital”</a> 
        for Japanese and Chinese, it was almost impossible for the women to 
        enter the hospital without endangering themselves. 
    </p> <br>
    
    <p id="Para18"> 
        For the next three years, the Japanese were tyrants and abused 
        <a href=”url” id="link37">many women</a>. 
        The medical knowledge the women acquired proved to be helpful for those around them. 
        Miao Chun continued to work in the hospital and was valued for her experience from serving during the
         <a href=”url” id="link38">First Sino-Japanese War</a>. 
         She hated the Japanese  more than anyone else and tried her best to smuggle 
         medication and equipment out as much as possible. This was very risky, 
         and it was difficult for her to manage alone. Ya Lan decided to volunteer as 
         an entertainer in the hospital to assist Miao Chun’s efforts. 
         To protect their safety, this was only known amongst the eight women. 
         Ya Lan suffered great humiliation both by the Japanese 
         and was despised and misunderstood by other Chinese. 
         Sheng Lan was barred from following her mother and continued to work as 
         a singer in Gay World (now a gambling den), together the mother and daughter 
         had access to intel which they spread to their sisters. Angered by the Japanese, 
         Ya Lan, Ah Jiao, and Miao Chun worked hard together to invent a poison to fight 
         against the aggressors, this was made from 
         <a href=”url” id="link39">tapioca roots</a> 
         and the last bit of rat poison they had. 
    </p> <br>
    
    <p id="Para19"> 
        Meanwhile, Ah Jiao managed to create an 
        <a href=”url” id="link40">obscured prayer hall</a> 
        for the fallen Chinese from the 
        <a href=”url” id="link41">Sook Ching operation</a>. 
        This also allowed her to share information and medication with other Chinese. 
        The poison created was distributed to the sisters, 
        it was used to spike the food of the Japanese. It helped to 
        slow down the mass killings  as many Japanese fell ill, 
        occasionally it even killed a few of them. Seeing the success of their invention, 
        Ya Lan wanted to share it with the women who got captured as 
        <a href=”url” id="link42">comfort women</a>. 
        But this was easier said than done, it was impossible to 
        come into contact with these women without being in danger themselves. 
        Sheng Lan was the only one who supported her mother, they saw the poison as a way 
        the women could do their part and also as a last-ditch attempt at revenge of any sort. 
        The two women worked in odd hours to dig a tunnel  where they could pass sachets of 
        the poison into the comfort houses. This went on for seven months before they were 
        exposed by one of the comfort women who took the sachets. 
        Ya Lan was caught and tortured by the Japanese. 
        No one knew what happened to her, but she snuck all the rat poison with her when 
        she was taken away. Ya Lan died of torture and rape, 
        it was rumored that four of the five Japanese soldiers 
        who abused her later died of poisoning.

        Ya Lan’s passing dealt  a huge blow to Sheng Lan and the society. Sheng Lan was crestfallen 
        and swore to defend everyone she could. She stood up and continued the poison making and distribution. 
        Clocking extra hours at the World, she used the money earned to sweep the 
        <a href=”url” id="link43">black market </a> for rat poison. 
        The morale was low as the number of sisters responding to the correspondences started to dwindle. 
        During this time, Ah Jiao enlisted the help of Ah Geok, a 
        <a href=”url” id="link44">samsui women </a> as an underground medical team for the locals. 
        These women were strong and quick, making them perfect for such a task. Due to a tip-off, 
        Shuang Shuang was mistaken as Ah Jiao and caught by the Japanese when she was tending to the shrine. 
        She left her bangle there right before being taken away. Determined to save her, 
        Ah Jiao decided to surrender herself to redeem Shuang Shuang. She left both bangles 
        with Ah Geok for safeguarding and said that it should be given to the society or sold for fundings 
        if they do not make it back. That was the last anyone heard of the
         <a href=”url” id="link45">couple</a>. 
         By 1945, Ah Jiao, Shuang Shuang and Miao Chun all sacrificed 
         as they got caught by the Japanese. Sheng Lan and Ah Geok kept in contact 
         through correspondence without meeting, working together now to save lives and 
         ceasing all aggressions to lie low. The sisters all went into hiding following 
         <a href=”url” id="link46">Japan’s surrender</a> as 
         <a href=”url” id="link47">anomie and looting</a> broke out.
