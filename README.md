"Index.html" is used to hold codes I am testing.

"BASE_links-and-media.html" is a WORKING CODE (template).
It is a:
  - WORKING CODE for hyperlinks, show and hide media
  - lacking <body>/<p> styling for the text
  
"Working.html" is a WORKING CODE
It has:
  - a href and id
  - styling properties
  - p and id
It is missing:
  - span and id
  - url for a
  - media for span
